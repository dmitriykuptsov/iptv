\label{section:introduction}

IPTV today is one of the most convenient way to view live TV channels.
Not only it is accessible wherever the Internet access exists, but 
also it gives a possibility to archive TV shows so that they can be 
viewed afterwards on demand. IPTV also gives a possibility to build
feature reach TV broadcasting services. For example, the TV viewing 
experience can be augmented with various quiz's, feedback, and even
context advertisements. 

In this document we will discuss how to build a simple IPTV service
using commodity hardware and open source software only. But before we dive into discussion
of the architecture, we will first elaborate on theory behind the 
service. Thus, we will give an overview, on a high level, for mathematics 
behind digital video broadcasting (DVB) standard, discuss various
standards including video encoding, error correction and modulation
schemes. 

With this respect, this paper is organized as follows. First, we 
will cover some background material. Here we will discuss the 
details of three DVB standards, then we will move on to theory
related to modulation and error correction techniques. Then,
we will overview MPEG and video coding standards. And finally, 
we will overview HTTP live streaming protocol (HLS) and devote 
few paragraphs to aspects related to security in HLS and DVB 
standards.
